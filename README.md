### :sunflower: Background

I loved playing the PC version of GTC as a kid. In May 2019, I needed an idea for a React/Node.js project for a uni course, so I decided to try out the possibilities of doing some simple game development with modern JS tools.

### :cactus: Roadmap

My first goal is to create a single-player version with hi-scores stored in a database. After that, I'll try to create some kind of online multiplayer support, but at the moment I only have a faint idea of how to go about that. Other nice-to-have features include touchscreen support, complex AI and decks with alternative art styles.
